==========
Eventually an automated way to take data from SIS to various other apps.

Started out using GAM (https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki).  
* Have to install python-openssl package with new version of GAM.


Long Range Goals

Eventually, go directly to a Google Client Library.  Either as webapp (https://www.djangoproject.com/) or maybe Electron (http://electron.atom.io/).
* Python (https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/quickstart/python)
* Node.js (https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/quickstart/nodejs)
