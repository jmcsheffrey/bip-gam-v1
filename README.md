==========
Eventually an automated way to take data from SIS to various other apps.

Started out using GAM (https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki).  
* Have to install python-openssl package with new version of GAM.
* Need to check these in firewall/filter:


Eventually, go directly to the Google Client Library for either:
* Python (https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/quickstart/python)
* Node.js (https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/quickstart/nodejs)

Possibly the node.js can be put inside Electron (http://electron.atom.io/)?
